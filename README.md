The task you've described involves creating two main pages: a home page and a product listing page. Here's a brief description of each:

Home Page:
The home page serves as the landing page for the application.
It should contain various sections or components as depicted in the provided image.
Components may include a header, banner/slider, featured products, special offers, etc.
Each component should be a functional component to adhere to the guidelines.
Redux should be implemented for state management, ensuring that data can be efficiently managed and updated across components.
The styling for the home page components should be done using SCSS to maintain consistency and ease of maintenance.
Proper commenting within the code should be done to explain the features and functionality of each component.
Product Listing Page:
This page is accessed when a user clicks on a category, displaying products related to that category.
It should fetch and display products from the provided API based on the category ID.
Again, functional components should be used exclusively.
Redux should be utilized for managing the state, ensuring seamless interaction between components and data management.
SCSS should be employed for styling components, adhering to a consistent design pattern.
Comments within the code should explain the logic and functionality of each feature.
For both pages, adherence to proper coding patterns and naming conventions is essential for code readability and maintainability. By following these guidelines, you'll ensure that the application is well-structured, efficient, and easy to maintain and extend in the future.
